                <p>His first album - 2000's “Animal Magic” - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a true musician's edge to electronica, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, “Dial M for Monkey” and “Days to Come”, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him evolve his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records.</p>      
                <p>He also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s “Black Sands”. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of “Black Sands” from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pitchard, Lapalux and Falty DL.</p>
