                            to the electronic section. But Simon Green, the man behind the simian moniker, doesn't really see himself
                            as an electronic artist.</blockquote>

                        <p>Over the course of five albums for the legendary label Ninja Tune, a myriad of tours, singles, remixes and production
                            work for other artists, Bonobo has built a large, loyal and engaged global fanbase: over half a million album
                            sales and over one hundred and fifty million streams on Spotify point to the levels of success achieved by
                            this quiet, self-effacing man. Most recently, Bonobo curated an international series of Outlier events including
                            a sold out all day festival at Tobacco Dock in London and further parties in Berlin, Madrid, Paris and New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>His first album - 2000's “Animal Magic” - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune.
                            It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a true musician's edge to electronica, with all the freedom
                            that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, “Dial M for Monkey” and “Days to Come”, developed his
                            sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him evolve his live show into a mesmeric re-working of
                            his records.</p>
